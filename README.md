Job Scheduling System

The Job Scheduling System is an implementation of the Greedy Algorithm designed to schedule jobs efficiently based on their profit and deadline. This project aims to maximize total profit by selecting the most optimal job sequence within a limited time frame. It demonstrates the practical use of Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) for solving real-world optimization problems.

Features

Implements Greedy Algorithm for optimal job selection.

Schedules jobs based on deadline and profit.

Displays selected jobs, execution order, and maximum profit.

Time-efficient and easy-to-understand code structure.

Useful for students, developers, and researchers learning algorithm optimization.

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Java (or Python/C++)

Algorithm: Greedy Algorithm

Data Structures: Arrays, Sorting, Priority Queue

How It Works

Input job details (Job ID, Deadline, Profit).

Sort all jobs in descending order of profit.

Assign each job to the latest available time slot before its deadline.

Display the final job sequence and total profit achieved.

Example
Job	Deadline	Profit
A	2	100
B	1	19
C	2	27
D	1	25
E	3	15

Output:
Scheduled Jobs ‚Üí A, C, E
Maximum Profit: 142

Time Complexity

Sorting: O(n log n)

Scheduling: O(n)

Overall: O(n log n)

Applications

CPU and process scheduling in operating systems

Project and resource allocation

Cloud computing optimization

Industrial workflow and task management

üèÅ Conclusion

This project efficiently applies the Greedy Algorithm to real-world scheduling problems, showing how local optimization can lead to globally efficient solutions. It serves as an educational and practical example for algorithm design and system optimization.
